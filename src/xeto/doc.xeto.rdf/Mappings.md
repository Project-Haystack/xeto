# Mapping Rules

Each Xeto construct below groups its RDF vocabulary, SHACL validation, and
instance-data mappings. A subsection is omitted when the construct has no
separate mapping for that profile.

## Specs, Slots, and Instances

### Vocabulary

Every Xeto spec is both a Xeto class and an RDFS class. Its name becomes an
English label, and its `doc` text becomes an English comment when present.

```xeto
Person : Dict <doc:"A person"> {
  dis: Str
}

Employee : Person
```

```turtle
ex:Person a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf sys:Dict ;
  rdfs:label "Person"@en ;
  rdfs:comment "A person"@en .

ex:Employee a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf ex:Person ;
  rdfs:label "Employee"@en .
```

The `rdfs:subClassOf` direction follows Xeto inheritance: every `Employee` is a
`Person`. References to specs in another library use that library's versioned
RDF namespace.

A **value-bearing slot** is a slot whose instance value is represented as the
object of an RDF statement, such as a string, number, reference, nested value,
choice, or list. This distinguishes it from a marker, which uses
`sys:hasMarker`, and a computed `Query`, which may use a property path.

Every value-bearing slot has its own property IRI. The local part combines the
spec name and slot name so slots with the same short name remain distinct.

```xeto
Site : Dict {
  site
}

Equip : Dict {
  dis: Str <doc:"Display name">
  siteRef: Ref<of:Site>
}
```

```turtle
ex:Site a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf sys:Dict ;
  rdfs:label "Site"@en ;
  sys:hasMarker ex:Site.site .

ex:Site.site a sys:Marker ;
  rdfs:label "site"@en .

ex:Equip a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf sys:Dict ;
  rdfs:label "Equip"@en .

ex:Equip.dis a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "dis"@en ;
  rdfs:comment "Display name"@en .

ex:Equip.siteRef a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "siteRef"@en .
```

The output preserves both classes and both slot properties. Property
declarations do not add an RDF domain or range: the
[SHACL Ref mapping](#ref-and-multiref-slots) states that `ex:Equip.siteRef`
must point to an `ex:Site`, while the class declarations identify `Equip` and
`Site` themselves.

### SHACL Validation

A spec with instance constraints is a `sh:NodeShape` targeting the same IRI as
its RDF class.

```turtle
ex:Equip a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Equip .
```

Vocabulary relationships determine which shapes apply. For example, a subtype
inherits its supertypes' constraints, an intersection is a subtype of every
member, and mixin properties are attached directly to the target shape. The corresponding RDF statements are shown under
[Intersections and Unions](#intersections-and-unions) and [Mixins](#mixins).

Ordinary Xeto slots use these cardinalities:

| Xeto slot | SHACL cardinality |
| --- | --- |
| required, single-valued | `sh:minCount 1`; `sh:maxCount 1` |
| `maybe`, single-valued | no minimum; `sh:maxCount 1` |
| required `MultiRef` | `sh:minCount 1`; no maximum |
| `maybe MultiRef` | no minimum or maximum |
| `Query` | no minimum or maximum |

The type and value constraints still apply when a `maybe` slot is present.
Marker, choice, and list cardinality have additional rules described in their
sections below.

#### Abstract Specs

Translate abstract specs using the same class and field-constraint mappings as
other specs. The `abstract` marker does not add a SHACL constraint prohibiting
records from declaring that type directly. For example:

```xeto
Abstract: Dict <abstract> { label: Str }
```
translates to:
```turtle
ex:Abstract a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Abstract ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Abstract.label ;
    sh:datatype xsd:string ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1
  ] .
```

#### Constraints on the `spec` Field

In Trio, the `spec` field identifies the record's declared Xeto type.
Constraints on this field use the shared RDF property `sys:spec`, including
inherited constraints and returned-record validation. For example:

```xeto
Record: Dict {
  spec: Ref
}
```

The slot constraint translates to:

```turtle
ex:Record a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Record ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path sys:spec ;
    sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
    sh:class rdfs:Class ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1
  ] .
```

This shape requires exactly one `sys:spec` value identifying an exported schema
class. It does not require that value to identify Record itself: a subtype
instance can refer to its own declared type. See [The `spec` Field](#the-spec-field)
for the instance mapping.

### Instance Data

A Xeto instance id becomes the subject IRI. A local id uses the instance
library's versioned namespace; a qualified id uses the named library's
versioned namespace. The instance is both a `sys:Entity` and an instance of its
effective spec.

```xeto
@site1: Site {
  site
}

@equip1: Equip {
  dis: "AHU-1"
  siteRef: @site1
}
```

```turtle
ex:site1 a sys:Entity, ex:Site ;
  sys:spec ex:Site ;
  sys:hasRefField sys:spec ;
  sys:hasMarker ex:Site.site .

ex:equip1 a sys:Entity, ex:Equip ;
  sys:spec ex:Equip ;
  sys:hasRefField sys:spec ;
  ex:Equip.dis "AHU-1"^^xsd:string ;
  ex:Equip.siteRef ex:site1 .
```

The subject IRI carries the Xeto id. No additional id predicate is required by
this profile.

#### The `spec` Field

Xeto instance syntax puts the declared type after the colon. The declaration
`@equip1: Equip` in the instance example identifies `Equip` as the instance's
type and implies a `spec` field referring to that definition. If `Equip` belongs
to library `example`, the corresponding `id` and `spec` fields in Trio are:

```trio
id: @example::equip1
spec: @example::Equip
```

The field identifies this record's declared type. Other Ref fields can also
refer to schema definitions; the special meaning of `spec` is that it names
the record's own type.

A Query can follow this Ref with `via:"spec"`. To preserve that traversal,
RDF needs a property containing the exact Ref in the field. `rdf:type` cannot
serve that purpose: it records type membership, which may include supertypes
or other type assertions. Following those memberships would introduce
traversal destinations that are not in the `spec` field.

The field therefore uses the shared RDF property `sys:spec`, separately from
`rdf:type`. The corresponding type and reference statements are:

```turtle
ex:equip1 a sys:Entity, ex:Equip ;
  sys:spec ex:Equip ;
  sys:hasRefField sys:spec .
```

An instance declared as a subtype identifies that subtype in its `spec` field,
not its parent type. It can therefore satisfy an inherited `spec: Ref`
requirement without referring to the parent: the requirement asks for a type
reference, not a reference to one particular type. Additional type memberships
must not create additional `sys:spec` values.

Following `sys:spec` looks for a runtime record with the referenced ID; the
schema definition alone is not a Query result. See
[Spec-Reference Traversal](Queries.md#spec-reference-traversal) for the selection rules
and examples.

Trio can also represent records without a `spec` field. If a record has no
stored `spec` field, the exporter must not add `sys:spec`, even when it assigns
the record an effective RDF type. Whether the field is required depends on
the applicable validation constraints. The same field mapping applies to
nested Dicts.

#### Effective Instance Values

Before exporting an instance, the exporter looks up the complete definition of
its spec in the active namespace. That definition includes inherited and global
slots, defaults supplied by Xeto, implied markers, choices, and slots added by
mixins. Using it ensures that RDF export interprets each entry the same way as
Xeto validation.

During RDF export, each compiled Xeto instance is resolved against its effective
spec. Required default values and implied markers from that spec are included
in the instance's exported RDF representation.

The resolved instance values are the source of truth:

- If resolving the instance supplies a value, that value appears in RDF.
- If a value is still absent after resolution, the exporter does not write an
  RDF statement for it.

```xeto
Target : Dict { target }

Defaults : Dict {
  implied
  label: Str "ready"
  targetRef: Ref?<of:Target>
}

@defaults1: Defaults {}
```

Although `defaults1` is empty in the source, its resolved values include the
required `label` default and the `implied` marker. Both therefore appear in RDF.
`targetRef` is optional and has no value, so the RDF contains no `targetRef`
statement:

```turtle
ex:defaults1 a sys:Entity, ex:Defaults ;
  ex:Defaults.label "ready"^^xsd:string ;
  sys:hasMarker ex:Defaults.implied .
```

This rule is the same for strings and other scalars, enums, units, references,
nested dictionaries, lists, and Choices. It also applies to defaults inherited
from a base spec, declared by a global slot, or contributed by a mixin. The
exporter writes such a default only when it is present in the resolved instance
values.

#### Undeclared Fields

The following `Person` spec declares only `dis`:

```xeto
Person : Dict {
  dis: Str
}
```

In this instance, `dis` is a declared slot. `nickname` is an undeclared
string-valued entry, and `imported` is an undeclared marker entry:

```xeto
@person1: Person {
  dis: "Ann"
  nickname: "Annie"
  imported
}
```

```turtle
ex:person1 a sys:Entity, ex:Person ;
  ex:Person.dis "Ann"^^xsd:string ;
  ex:Person.nickname "Annie"^^xsd:string ;
  sys:hasMarker ex:Person.imported .
```

An undeclared value-bearing entry uses a property IRI formed from the
instance's concrete spec and entry name. An undeclared marker uses
`sys:hasMarker` and the corresponding marker IRI. These extra entries do not
cause the open SHACL shape to reject an otherwise valid instance.

## Standard Scalar Slots

A plain Xeto scalar maps to an RDF typed literal. A typed literal contains a
lexical form and a datatype. The quoted text in Turtle is the lexical form; it
does not mean that every scalar is an `xsd:string`.

The scalar's effective Xeto type determines the datatype. The exporter does not
infer the datatype from the value's appearance. For example:

```xeto
Reading : Dict {
  label: Str
  count: Int
  value: Number
  ratio: Float
}

@reading1: Reading {
  label: "5"
  count: 5
  value: 5
  ratio: 5e-1
}
```

```turtle
ex:reading1 a sys:Entity, ex:Reading ;
  ex:Reading.label "5"^^xsd:string ;
  ex:Reading.count "5"^^xsd:integer ;
  ex:Reading.value "5.0"^^xsd:double ;
  ex:Reading.ratio "0.5"^^xsd:double .
```

The same type mapping selects the SHACL datatype:

| Xeto type | RDF datatype |
| --- | --- |
| `Str` | `xsd:string` |
| `Number` | `xsd:double` |
| `Float` | `xsd:double` |
| `Int` | `xsd:integer` |
| `Bool` | `xsd:boolean` |
| `Date` | `xsd:date` |
| `Time` | `xsd:time` |
| `DateTime` | `xsd:dateTime` |
| `Uri` | `xsd:anyURI` |
| `TimeZone` | `xsd:string` |

### SHACL Validation

A unit bearing `Number` is an exception, it maps to a `qudt:QuantityValue` node
rather than a plain literal, as described under
[Units and Quantities](#units-and-quantities).

`Float` is always unitless in Xeto and therefore never uses the QUDT quantity
mapping. Number and Float share the same finite and special double values:
`"NaN"^^xsd:double`, `"INF"^^xsd:double`, and `"-INF"^^xsd:double`. Negative
zero retains its sign. `NaN` cannot be used for `minVal` or `maxVal` because it
has no numeric order.

Numeric `minVal` and `maxVal` map to inclusive bounds.

```xeto
Sensor : Dict {
  sampleInterval: Int <minVal:1, maxVal:60>
}
```

```turtle
ex:Sensor a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Sensor ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Sensor.sampleInterval ;
    sh:datatype xsd:integer ;
    sh:minInclusive 1 ;
    sh:maxInclusive 60 ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

String `minSize`, `maxSize`, and `nonEmpty` map to `sh:minLength`,
`sh:maxLength`, and `sh:pattern`. `nonEmpty` uses the pattern `\\S`, which
requires at least one non-whitespace character. Explicit `pattern` metadata
also maps to `sh:pattern`.

```xeto
Asset : Dict {
  dis: Str <nonEmpty, minSize:2, maxSize:40>
}
```

```turtle
ex:Asset a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Asset ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Asset.dis ;
    sh:datatype xsd:string ;
    sh:minLength 2 ;
    sh:maxLength 40 ;
    sh:pattern "\\S" ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

An invariant slot value maps to `sh:hasValue` with the scalar's RDF datatype.
An ordinary default value does not constrain instance data.

```xeto
Thing : Dict {
  fixed: Str <invariant> "ok"
  label: Str "fallback"
}
```

```turtle
ex:Thing a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Thing ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Thing.fixed ;
    sh:datatype xsd:string ;
    sh:hasValue "ok"^^xsd:string ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Thing.label ;
    sh:datatype xsd:string ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

### Instance Data

Scalar values use the datatypes from the scalar mapping table. For example:

```xeto
Sensor : Dict {
  dis: Str
  priority: Int
  enabled: Bool
  commissioned: Date
}

@sensor1: Sensor {
  dis: "Zone Temp"
  priority: 5
  enabled: "true"
  commissioned: 2026-07-19
}
```

```turtle
ex:sensor1 a sys:Entity, ex:Sensor ;
  ex:Sensor.dis "Zone Temp"^^xsd:string ;
  ex:Sensor.priority "5"^^xsd:integer ;
  ex:Sensor.enabled "true"^^xsd:boolean ;
  ex:Sensor.commissioned "2026-07-19"^^xsd:date .
```

## Custom Scalar Datatypes

A custom Xeto scalar is a named type derived from `Scalar`, directly or through
another scalar type, with its own value constraints or encoding.

A concrete Xeto scalar without a specialized RDF mapping maps to a custom RDF
datatype. Its datatype IRI is the scalar spec's IRI in its versioned library
namespace. For example, `Code` in the example library maps to `ex:Code`.

Each value maps to an RDF literal whose datatype is that IRI and whose lexical
form is Xeto's string encoding of the value: `"AB"^^ex:Code`. This encoding
represents the scalar value; it does not imply that the value is a string.
The encoded form may differ from the original Xeto source spelling.

The mapping preserves type identity and encoded content. SHACL enforces
explicit constraints such as patterns, but does not reproduce native parsing,
comparison, execution, or resource lookup. These rules apply equally to
user-defined scalars and the built-in scalars listed below.

Types with an existing special mapping keep that mapping, including
refinements of [standard scalars](#standard-scalar-slots), enums, markers,
references, and units. The built-in scalars covered by the custom datatype
rule are listed [below](#built-in-and-library-scalars).

### Vocabulary

The vocabulary declares the scalar spec's IRI as an `rdfs:Datatype`:

```xeto
Code : Scalar <pattern:"[A-Z]{2}">

Asset : Dict {
  code: Code
}
```

```turtle
ex:Code a rdfs:Datatype ;
  rdfs:label "Code"@en .
```

The declaration names the datatype. The following shape enforces its pattern
when a value is used in `Asset.code`.

### SHACL Validation

A custom scalar slot checks the value's datatype with `sh:datatype` and its
declared pattern with `sh:pattern`. Required and optional slots follow the
ordinary cardinality rules.

```turtle
ex:Asset a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Asset ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Asset.code ;
    sh:datatype ex:Code ;
    sh:pattern "[A-Z]{2}" ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

A custom scalar subtype maps to its own RDF datatype. Its shape preserves
both its declared patterns and those inherited from its base type:

```xeto
UpperCode : Scalar <pattern:"[A-Z]+">
FourCharacterCode : UpperCode <pattern:"[A-Z0-9]{4}">

Asset : Dict {
  code: FourCharacterCode
}
```

```turtle
ex:UpperCode a rdfs:Datatype ;
  rdfs:label "UpperCode"@en .

ex:FourCharacterCode a rdfs:Datatype ;
  rdfs:label "FourCharacterCode"@en ;
  rdfs:subClassOf ex:UpperCode .

ex:Asset a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Asset ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Asset.code ;
    sh:datatype ex:FourCharacterCode ;
    sh:and (
      [ sh:pattern "[A-Z]+" ]
      [ sh:pattern "[A-Z0-9]{4}" ]
    ) ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

The slot's pattern constraints come from its declared scalar type, that type's
base types, and any pattern declared directly on the slot. Every applicable
pattern must be satisfied. Multiple distinct patterns map to separate shapes
within `sh:and`. SHACL permits only one `sh:pattern` value per shape under its
[multiple-parameter rule](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#multiple-parameters).

An invariant custom scalar value maps to `sh:hasValue` with the slot's
datatype:

```xeto
Code : Scalar <pattern:"[A-Z]{2}">

FixedAsset : Dict {
  code: Code <invariant> "AB"
}
```

```turtle
ex:Code a rdfs:Datatype ;
  rdfs:label "Code"@en .

ex:FixedAsset a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:FixedAsset ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:FixedAsset.code ;
    sh:datatype ex:Code ;
    sh:pattern "[A-Z]{2}" ;
    sh:hasValue "AB"^^ex:Code ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

`"AB"^^ex:Code` and `"AB"^^xsd:string` have the same text but different
datatypes. Only the first satisfies this invariant. An ordinary default does
not produce an `sh:hasValue` constraint.

### Instance Data

Using the `Code` and `Asset` declarations above:

```xeto
@asset1: Asset {
  code: "AB"
}
```

```turtle
ex:asset1 a sys:Entity, ex:Asset ;
  ex:Asset.code "AB"^^ex:Code .
```

For a slot declared with a custom scalar type, the slot's effective type
determines the literal's datatype. A slot declared as `UpperCode` therefore
uses `ex:UpperCode`, matching its `sh:datatype` constraint. The same rule
applies to supported list items with a declared scalar type and to scalar
slots in nested values.

An `Obj` slot does not declare a specific scalar type. The RDF datatype
therefore comes from the stored value's Xeto type. An explicitly typed `Code`
value retains that type; an ordinary string remains `xsd:string`:

```xeto
Envelope : Dict {
  value: Obj
}

@coded: Envelope {
  value: Code "AB"
}

@plain: Envelope {
  value: "AB"
}
```

```turtle
ex:coded a sys:Entity, ex:Envelope ;
  ex:Envelope.value "AB"^^ex:Code .

ex:plain a sys:Entity, ex:Envelope ;
  ex:Envelope.value "AB"^^xsd:string .
```

The export input must preserve a custom scalar value's type information.
If that information is missing, the exporter reports an error rather than
converting the custom value to an ordinary string.

### Built-in and Library Scalars

The same rule covers built-in and library scalars without another special
mapping. For example:

```turtle
sys:Version a rdfs:Datatype .
sys:Buf a rdfs:Datatype .

ex:record ex:version "1.2.3"^^sys:Version ;
  ex:payload "-_8"^^sys:Buf .
```

The text preserves what Xeto encoded. It does not make RDF tools understand
version ordering or binary data. `Duration` also uses this rule, even though
its Xeto base is `Number`.

| Other scalar | RDF representation | What RDF does not do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Version` | Xeto version text with datatype `sys:Version` | Compare version parts or check native parser limits |
| `Buf` | Xeto base64url text with datatype `sys:Buf` | Convert to `xsd:base64Binary` or decode the bytes |
| `Duration` | Xeto duration text with datatype `sys:Duration` | Perform time arithmetic or convert to a QUDT quantity |
| `Span` | Xeto span text with datatype `sys:Span` | Resolve relative dates or preserve context absent from the encoding |
| `Filter` | Xeto filter text with datatype `sys:Filter` | Parse, execute, or translate the filter to SPARQL |
| `LibDependVersions`, `LibFilePattern` | Selector text with the corresponding Xeto datatype | Resolve dependencies or inspect files |
| `None`, `NA` | The explicit value's Xeto encoding with its own datatype | Treat the value as omission, JSON null, or numeric NaN |
| `BuildVar` | A surviving placeholder's encoding with datatype `sys:BuildVar` | Perform build substitution |
| Other scalars, such as `pi::Icon`, `ph::Coord`, and user-defined `Code` | Xeto-encoded text with the scalar's versioned type IRI | Look up resources, split values into fields, or add type-specific parsing |

Values already replaced or removed by Xeto are not recreated during export.
A resolved build variable uses the mapping for its resulting value.

## Other Core Types

Most dictionary types need no special mapping. A type derived from `Dict` uses
the ordinary class, nested-object, and slot rules in this chapter. For example,
`Err` is a dictionary with `dis` and optional `errTrace` slots:

```xeto
Failure : Err

Envelope : Dict {
  failure: Failure?
}
```

```turtle
ex:Failure a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf sys:Err ;
  rdfs:label "Failure"@en .

ex:Envelope a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Envelope ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Envelope.failure ;
    sh:node ex:Failure ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

The following core types do not have mappings in this version:

| Xeto type | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `Grid` | A grid mapping must define rows, columns, cells, metadata, and ordering. |
| `Collection` | The abstract collection type does not identify a concrete RDF value representation. |
| `Func` | Function parameters, return values, and execution are outside the current data profiles. |
| `Interface`, `Funcs`, and `File` | API contracts, callable operations, and file handles are outside the current data profiles. |

An exporter reports that the affected spec is unsupported when one of these
types is used as an RDF value type. It does not treat the value as a string,
dictionary, or unconstrained object. `Entity`, `Err`, and other ordinary
dictionary types continue to use the `Dict` mapping.

This check follows the complete inheritance chain. For example, a
`SpecialGrid` derived from `Grid` is still a grid value, so a slot whose type is
`SpecialGrid` fails with the unsupported Grid diagnostic. Giving an unsupported
core type an application-specific name does not turn it into a dictionary or
an unconstrained object.

## Unconstrained Object Slots

### SHACL Validation

An `Obj` slot constrains presence and single-value cardinality but deliberately
does not constrain the RDF term's datatype, class, or node kind.

```xeto
Envelope : Dict {
  value: Obj
}
```

```turtle
ex:Envelope a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Envelope ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Envelope.value ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

## Markers

### Vocabulary

A marker slot is represented as a named marker resource rather than as a
boolean-valued property.

```xeto
Equip : Dict {
  equip
}
```

```turtle
ex:Equip sys:hasMarker ex:Equip.equip .

ex:Equip.equip a sys:Marker ;
  rdfs:label "equip"@en .
```

The first statement records that `equip` is a marker declared by `Equip`. The
instance-data mapping uses the same marker IRI when an instance carries that
marker.

### SHACL Validation

A required marker uses `sh:hasValue` on `sys:hasMarker`. It does not use
`sh:maxCount`, because one instance may carry many different markers.

```turtle
ex:Equip a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Equip ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path sys:hasMarker ;
    sh:hasValue ex:Equip.equip ;
  ] .
```

A `maybe` marker still has vocabulary metadata, but it does not add a required
`sh:hasValue` constraint. For example:

```xeto
Asset : Dict {
  temporary: Marker?
}
```

```turtle
ex:Asset sys:hasMarker ex:Asset.temporary .

ex:Asset.temporary a sys:Marker ;
  rdfs:label "temporary"@en .

ex:Asset a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Asset .
```

The marker is part of the exported vocabulary, but an `Asset` instance may
omit it because the shape has no `sh:hasValue ex:Asset.temporary` constraint.

### Instance Data

An instance marker uses `sys:hasMarker` and the marker resource declared by the
vocabulary mapping above.

```xeto
@equip1: Equip {
  equip
}
```

```turtle
ex:equip1 sys:hasMarker ex:Equip.equip .
```

Xeto may supply a required marker from the spec even when it is not repeated in
the authored instance. For example:

```xeto
Equip : Dict {
  equip
}

@equip1: Equip {}
```

The `equip` marker is required by `Equip`, so the exported instance includes
it once:

```turtle
ex:equip1 a sys:Entity, ex:Equip ;
  sys:hasMarker ex:Equip.equip .
```

## Enums

An enum's entry names define its allowed string values unless an entry supplies
an explicit `key`.

```xeto
Suit : Enum {
  clubs
  diamonds
}

Card : Dict {
  suit: Suit
}
```

### Vocabulary

An enum spec is exported as a class, and the slot using it is exported as an
RDF property. Ordinary enum values are strings rather than RDF individuals,
so the vocabulary graph does not create a resource for each entry.

Some built-in enums have their own RDF mappings instead of this default string
mapping. For example, `Unit` and
[UnitQuantity](#standalone-unitquantity-values) represent their values as
resources, as described in their respective sections.

```turtle
ex:Suit a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf sys:Enum ;
  rdfs:label "Suit"@en .

ex:Card.suit a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "suit"@en .
```

### SHACL Validation

Ordinary enum slots are string-valued and use `sh:in` for the allowed values. For the
unkeyed `Suit` above, the entry names are used directly:

```turtle
ex:Card a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Card ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Card.suit ;
    sh:datatype xsd:string ;
    sh:in ("clubs"^^xsd:string "diamonds"^^xsd:string) ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

If an enum entry declares `key` metadata, that key becomes the allowed value:

```xeto
Suit : Enum {
  clubs    <key:"Clubs">
  diamonds <key:"Diamonds">
}

Card : Dict {
  suit: Suit
}
```

The vocabulary declarations are unchanged. Only the `sh:in` values differ:

```turtle
ex:Card a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Card ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Card.suit ;
    sh:datatype xsd:string ;
    sh:in ("Clubs"^^xsd:string "Diamonds"^^xsd:string) ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

The allowed values are therefore `"Clubs"` and `"Diamonds"`, not `"clubs"`
and `"diamonds"`.

Xeto enum definitions cannot be inherited. The Xeto compiler rejects a spec
that attempts to derive from an enum, so an enum slot's allowed values come
from the enum named by that slot. There is no additional enum-inheritance rule
in the RDF mapping.

### Instance Data

For the unkeyed enum, an instance uses the entry name as its string value:

```xeto
@card1: Card {
  suit: "clubs"
}
```

```turtle
ex:card1 a sys:Entity, ex:Card ;
  ex:Card.suit "clubs"^^xsd:string .
```

For the keyed definition, the instance and RDF literal use the explicit key:

```xeto
@card2: Card {
  suit: "Clubs"
}
```

```turtle
ex:card2 a sys:Entity, ex:Card ;
  ex:Card.suit "Clubs"^^xsd:string .
```

## Ref and MultiRef Slots

### SHACL Validation

A `Ref` value is an IRI. A typed ref requires the referenced resource to belong
to the target class. An untyped ref requires `sys:Entity`, which also prevents a
dangling IRI from satisfying the shape.

```xeto
Site : Dict

Equip : Dict {
  siteRef: Ref<of:Site>
  related: MultiRef?<of:Equip>
  auxRef: Ref?
}
```

```turtle
ex:Equip a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Equip ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Equip.siteRef ;
    sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
    sh:class ex:Site ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Equip.related ;
    sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
    sh:class ex:Equip ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Equip.auxRef ;
    sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
    sh:class sys:Entity ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

Every value of a `MultiRef` must satisfy the node-kind and class constraints.

A record declared as a [Query body member](Queries.md#query-body-validation) can satisfy
a typed reference through inheritance. For example:

```xeto
Target: Dict {}
Twins: Dict {
  next: MultiRef?
  results: Query<of:Target, via:"next"> {
    first: Target
  }
}
Holder: Dict { targetRef: Ref<of:Target> }
```

The `first` declaration creates the type `Twins.results.first`, which derives
from Target. A record declared as that type can therefore be the value of
Holder's `targetRef`. This is an ordinary reference check; it does not require
running Query-body validation.

The exporter declares the member's class and nominal inheritance in the
validation vocabulary:

```turtle
ex:Twins.results.first a rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf ex:Target .
```

The reference therefore uses the ordinary class constraint:

```turtle
sh:class ex:Target
```

An unchanged inherited member retains the declaring member's identity. An
override has its own member identity and exports its effective nominal base.
These declarations describe types; they do not run Query-body validation.

Computed sugar membership needs a separate check. For example:

```xeto
Target: Dict { *hot: Marker, *label: Str }
Hot: Target <sugar> { hot, label: Str "default" }
Owner: Dict {
  results: Query<of:Target, via:"next"> {
    wanted: Target { hot }
  }
}
Holder: Dict { targetRef: Ref<of:Hot> }
```

Xeto recognizes `Owner.results.wanted` as a computed sugar subtype of Hot
because the member requires `hot`. The member does not inherit Hot's `label`
field. A reference to Hot must accept records declared as this member without
applying Hot's additional field constraints:

```turtle
sh:or (
  [ sh:class ex:Hot ]
  [ sh:class ex:Owner.results.wanted ]
)
```

Keep this alternative in the reference's validation shape. Under the current
validation mapping, do not export this computed relationship as
`rdfs:subClassOf ex:Hot`: that statement would also cause Hot's validation shape
to check the member records and require `label`.

When matching against sugar, a body-member type (such as `Owner.results.wanted`)
may need a `sh:or` alternative. Include matching member types from the resolved
namespace only when inheritance does not already satisfy the class check.
Apply the same rule to `MultiRef` and reusable result constraints. Keep computed
sugar matches separate from subclass relationships, which also activate
validation constraints.

### Instance Data

A `Ref` becomes one object IRI. A `MultiRef` becomes one triple per referenced
IRI using the same property.

```xeto
Site : Dict

Equip : Dict {
  siteRef: Ref<of:Site>
  related: MultiRef?<of:Equip>
}

@site1: Site {}
@equip2: Equip { siteRef: @site1 }
@equip3: Equip { siteRef: @site1 }

@equip1: Equip {
  siteRef: @site1
  related: MultiRef {
    @equip2
    @equip3
  }
}
```

```turtle
ex:site1 a sys:Entity, ex:Site .

ex:equip2 a sys:Entity, ex:Equip ;
  ex:Equip.siteRef ex:site1 ;
  sys:hasRefField ex:Equip.siteRef .

ex:equip3 a sys:Entity, ex:Equip ;
  ex:Equip.siteRef ex:site1 ;
  sys:hasRefField ex:Equip.siteRef .

ex:equip1 a sys:Entity, ex:Equip ;
  ex:Equip.siteRef ex:site1 ;
  ex:Equip.related ex:equip2, ex:equip3 ;
  sys:hasRefField ex:Equip.siteRef, ex:Equip.related .
```

The single `siteRef` value produces one statement. The two `related` values
produce two statements with the same subject and property. Referenced Xeto
entities are exported with their own `sys:Entity` and concrete spec types so
typed and untyped reference shapes can validate them.

#### Reference-field metadata

RDF uses IRIs for Refs, Units, UnitQuantity values, and named nested Dicts.
A link alone does not show which Xeto value produced it. `sys:hasRefField`
identifies a Ref or MultiRef field on the record that stores it; the value of
`sys:hasRefField` is the field's property IRI.

| Stored Xeto value | Xeto Query behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Ref to an existing record | Follow it and consider that record for results. |
| Ref to a missing record | Return no result from that branch. |
| Unit, UnitQuantity, or named nested Dict | Fail if the Query tries to follow it as a Ref. |

Without this metadata, SPARQL could return an empty result for the last case
where Xeto reports an error. Query input validation uses `sys:hasRefField` to
preserve that distinction.

A Ref contains the ID of another record. That referenced record need not be
present in the dataset. In library `example.people`, the metadata belongs to
the record holding the Ref (`ex:` denotes that library's RDF namespace):

The following RDF excerpts show instance data; schema triples are omitted.

```xeto
Person: Dict { address: Ref }
@person1: Person { address: Ref "example.people::missingAddress" }
```

```turtle
ex:person1 a sys:Entity, ex:Person ;
  ex:Person.address ex:missingAddress ;
  sys:hasRefField ex:Person.address .
# No record for ex:missingAddress is present in this graph.
```

The graph contains the IRI `ex:missingAddress`, but no record describing that
address, so this branch returns no result. `sys:hasRefField` describes the Ref
stored on person1, not whether the address record exists. Separate record
validation may reject the dangling Ref.

Before following a field with values, Query input validation requires its
`sys:hasRefField` statement. For example, following `address` on person1 above
passes this check; removing the statement makes it fail. This prevents a nested
Dict or a Unit IRI such as `unit:PA` from being mistaken for a Ref. An absent
field or an empty MultiRef has nothing to follow and needs no statement.
Consumers must preserve these statements when copying or transforming RDF.

Exporters use the stored value to decide whether to add `sys:hasRefField`,
including for `Obj` slots and undeclared fields. If a field is exported under
several property IRIs, such as inherited aliases, the exporter lists each
property IRI as a value of `sys:hasRefField` on the owning record.
For example, an override narrows an inherited Ref to an Address Ref. The
export retains both property IRIs and identifies both as reference fields:

```xeto
Address: Dict {}
Person: Dict { address: Ref }
Employee: Person { address: Ref<of:Address> }
@address1: Address {}
@employee1: Employee { address: @address1 }
```

```turtle
ex:address1 a sys:Entity, ex:Address .
ex:employee1 a sys:Entity, ex:Employee ;
  ex:Person.address ex:address1 ;
  ex:Employee.address ex:address1 ;
  sys:hasRefField ex:Person.address, ex:Employee.address .
```

For an explicitly stored empty MultiRef, the exporter lists the field's
property IRI under `sys:hasRefField`, but there are no referenced IDs to export.
An absent field produces neither reference values nor `sys:hasRefField` metadata:

```xeto
Group: Dict { members: MultiRef? }
@group1: Group { members: MultiRef {} }
```

```turtle
ex:group1 a sys:Entity, ex:Group ;
  sys:hasRefField ex:Group.members .
# No ex:Group.members values: the MultiRef is empty.
```

## Nested Object Slots

### SHACL Validation

A slot typed as another dictionary spec uses `sh:node` to apply that spec's
shape to the nested value.

```xeto
Address : Dict {
  city: Str
}

PostalAddress : Address

Person : Dict {
  address: Address
  postalAddress: PostalAddress?
}
```

```turtle
ex:Person a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Person ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Person.address ;
    sh:node ex:Address ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Person.postalAddress ;
    sh:node ex:PostalAddress ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

Dictionary inheritance may pass through more than one spec. The exporter
follows the complete inheritance chain, but `sh:node` names the slot's declared
type; in this example, `PostalAddress`. If that type is declared by a dependency,
the same rule applies using the dependency library's RDF namespace. A loaded
`addresses::PostalAddress`, for example, becomes
`sh:node addresses:PostalAddress`.

The nested node may itself contain scalar, ref, marker, unit, list, choice, or
further nested values supported by this specification.

### Instance Data

A nested dictionary without its own Xeto id becomes an RDF blank node. It is
typed with its nested spec so both class-based and `sh:node` constraints can
recognize it.

```xeto
@person1: Person {
  address: Address {
    city: "Richmond"
  }
  postalAddress: PostalAddress {
    city: "Richmond"
  }
}
```

```turtle
ex:person1 a sys:Entity, ex:Person ;
  ex:Person.address [
    a ex:Address ;
    ex:Address.city "Richmond"^^xsd:string
  ] ;
  ex:Person.postalAddress [
    a ex:PostalAddress ;
    ex:Address.city "Richmond"^^xsd:string
  ] .
```

If the nested instance has its own Xeto id, that id becomes a named RDF
individual instead of a blank node.

```xeto
@person1: Person {
  address @address1: Address {
    city: "Richmond"
  }
}
```

```turtle
ex:person1 ex:Person.address ex:address1 .

ex:address1 a sys:Entity, ex:Address ;
  ex:Address.city "Richmond"^^xsd:string .
```

## Choices

### Vocabulary

A choice root is a class, and every choice member is its subclass. Each member
is connected to the marker that selects it in Xeto.

```xeto
HeatingProcess : Choice
HotWaterHeating : HeatingProcess { hotWaterHeating }
SteamHeating : HeatingProcess { steamHeating }
```

```turtle
ex:HeatingProcess a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf sys:Choice ;
  rdfs:label "HeatingProcess"@en .

ex:HotWaterHeating a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf ex:HeatingProcess ;
  rdfs:label "HotWaterHeating"@en ;
  sys:hasMarker ex:HotWaterHeating.hotWaterHeating .

ex:HotWaterHeating.hotWaterHeating a sys:Marker ;
  rdfs:label "hotWaterHeating"@en .

ex:SteamHeating a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf ex:HeatingProcess ;
  rdfs:label "SteamHeating"@en ;
  sys:hasMarker ex:SteamHeating.steamHeating .

ex:SteamHeating.steamHeating a sys:Marker ;
  rdfs:label "steamHeating"@en .
```

Choice members are collected from the active namespace. A library may add a
member to a non-sealed choice defined by another library, so two namespaces can
produce different allowed-member lists for the same choice root.

Members may form more than one level of taxonomy. Every marker-bearing
descendant is a member of each Choice above it, not only of its immediate
parent.

```xeto
PointFunction : Choice
SensorPointFunction : PointFunction { sensor }
SyntheticPointFunction : PointFunction { synthetic }
ComputedSyntheticPointFunction : SyntheticPointFunction { computed }

Point : Dict {
  pointFunction: PointFunction?
}
```

The `Point.pointFunction` shape contains all three marker-bearing descendants:

```turtle
ex:Point a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Point ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Point.pointFunction ;
    sh:in (
      ex:ComputedSyntheticPointFunction
      ex:SensorPointFunction
      ex:SyntheticPointFunction
    ) ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

The exporter removes duplicate qualified names and orders the remaining names
consistently. The same rule applies when the Choice root or any descendants
come from loaded dependency libraries.

A slot may also use a marker-bearing intermediate Choice as its type. That
slot accepts the intermediate member itself and the marker-bearing descendants
under that branch. Members of sibling branches are not included in its
`sh:in` list.

### SHACL Validation

The vocabulary mapping above defines the choice root, member classes, and
member-marker metadata. The validation mapping defines how a slot selects one
or more of those members. A choice slot uses its ordinary slot property as an
RDF-native relationship to the selected member. `sh:in` checks exact member
IRIs; it does not treat the selected member as a nested object.

```xeto
Equip : Dict {
  heatingProcess: HeatingProcess
}
```

```turtle
ex:Equip a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Equip ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Equip.heatingProcess ;
    sh:in (ex:HotWaterHeating ex:SteamHeating) ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

Choice cardinality follows the call-site metadata:

| Xeto choice slot | SHACL cardinality |
| --- | --- |
| `heatingProcess: HeatingProcess` | `sh:minCount 1`; `sh:maxCount 1` |
| `heatingProcess: HeatingProcess?` | no minimum; `sh:maxCount 1` |
| `heatingProcess: HeatingProcess <multiChoice>` | `sh:minCount 1`; no maximum |
| `heatingProcess: HeatingProcess? <multiChoice>` | no minimum or maximum |

Every value, including each value of a multi-choice slot, must appear in the
`sh:in` list. The list contains all members visible in the active namespace.

### Instance Data

The selected choice member is the object of the choice slot property.

```xeto
@equip1: Equip {
  hotWaterHeating
}
```

```turtle
ex:equip1 ex:Equip.heatingProcess ex:HotWaterHeating .
```

For multi-choice, the subject has one property value for each selected member.
For example:

```xeto
MultiFuelEquip : Dict {
  heatingProcesses: HeatingProcess <multiChoice>
}

@boiler1: MultiFuelEquip {
  hotWaterHeating
  steamHeating
}
```

```turtle
ex:boiler1 a sys:Entity, ex:MultiFuelEquip ;
  ex:MultiFuelEquip.heatingProcesses ex:HotWaterHeating,
                                      ex:SteamHeating .
```

The instance property points to the choice member IRI. The vocabulary graph
connects that member to the Xeto marker that selects it:

```turtle
ex:equip1 ex:Equip.heatingProcess ex:HotWaterHeating .
ex:HotWaterHeating sys:hasMarker ex:HotWaterHeating.hotWaterHeating .
```

A user can therefore find equipment selected by the `hotWaterHeating` marker
without requiring a second marker statement on every instance:

```sparql
SELECT ?equip WHERE {
  ?equip ex:Equip.heatingProcess ?choice .
  ?choice sys:hasMarker ex:HotWaterHeating.hotWaterHeating .
}
```

The exporter checks the completed instance's marker values, not marker names
found only on the spec. One matching member produces one choice-property value;
`multiChoice` produces one value for every matching member. The RDF instance
does not repeat those selection markers as `sys:hasMarker` statements. Other
instance markers are still exported normally.

## Lists

### SHACL Validation

A Xeto `List` is one ordered collection, not several independent values for the
same slot. RDF represents that collection as a linked list: each node stores
one item in `rdf:first` and points to the remainder of the list through
`rdf:rest`. The exporter checks each `rdf:first` value against the Xeto `of`
type. It counts the linked-list nodes separately so repeated values still count
as separate list items when enforcing `minSize` and `maxSize`.

```xeto
Batch : Dict {
  names: List <of:Str, minSize:2, maxSize:3>
}
```

```turtle
ex:Batch a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Batch ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Batch.names ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
    sh:node [
      sh:property [
        sh:path ( [ sh:zeroOrMorePath rdf:rest ] rdf:first ) ;
        sh:datatype xsd:string ;
      ] ;
      sh:property [
        sh:path [ sh:zeroOrMorePath rdf:rest ] ;
        sh:minCount 3 ;
        sh:maxCount 4 ;
      ]
    ] ;
  ] .
```

An RDF list containing `n` items has `n + 1` nodes because the chain ends at
the additional `rdf:nil` node. Xeto's `minSize` and `maxSize` item counts are
therefore increased by one when converted to these SHACL node counts. In the
example above, `minSize:2` becomes `sh:minCount 3`, and `maxSize:3` becomes
`sh:maxCount 4`.

`nonEmpty` requires at least one list item. Its SHACL node count is two: one
item node plus the terminating `rdf:nil` node.

```xeto
Batch : Dict {
  tags: List <of:Str, nonEmpty>
}
```

```turtle
ex:Batch a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Batch ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Batch.tags ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
    sh:node [
      sh:property [
        sh:path ( [ sh:zeroOrMorePath rdf:rest ] rdf:first ) ;
        sh:datatype xsd:string ;
      ] ;
      sh:property [
        sh:path [ sh:zeroOrMorePath rdf:rest ] ;
        sh:minCount 2 ;
      ]
    ] ;
  ] .
```

When `of` names a dictionary spec, every list item must be an instance of that
spec, so the exporter uses `sh:class`. Scalar item types instead use
`sh:datatype`.

Lists of enum values, Choice selections, units, references, or other lists are
not supported in this version. Exporting one of these list forms is an error;
see [Deferred Mappings](Deferred.md#deferred-mappings).

### Instance Data

A Xeto list becomes an RDF collection, preserving item order.

```xeto
@batch1: Batch {
  names: { "alpha", "beta" }
}
```

```turtle
ex:batch1 a sys:Entity, ex:Batch ;
  ex:Batch.names ("alpha"^^xsd:string "beta"^^xsd:string) .
```

The parenthesized Turtle syntax is shorthand for an `rdf:first`/`rdf:rest`
chain. The same collection can be written out as:

```turtle
ex:batch1 ex:Batch.names _:names1 .

_:names1 rdf:first "alpha"^^xsd:string ;
  rdf:rest _:names2 .

_:names2 rdf:first "beta"^^xsd:string ;
  rdf:rest rdf:nil .
```

The final `rdf:rest rdf:nil` is implicit in the parenthesized form. A malformed
chain that never reaches `rdf:nil` is not a well-formed RDF list.

## Units and Quantities

### Unit and Quantity Correspondence

Xeto defines `sys::Unit` from the standard Project Haystack unit database. Each
unit has a full name and may have one or more symbol aliases. For example,
`square_meter` has the symbol `m²`, while `hour` has both `hr` and `h`. When a
unit has multiple symbols, the last symbol in the standard database is its
preferred display form.

The complete Xeto unit catalog is defined by the
[Xeto `sys::Unit` source](https://github.com/Project-Haystack/xeto/blob/master/src/xeto/sys/units.xeto).

This specification classifies every unit and quantity in the current Xeto
catalog through machine-readable properties files:

- [Xeto unit to QUDT unit or currency](https://github.com/Project-Haystack/xeto/blob/master/src/xeto/sys.rdf/qudt-units.props)
- [Xeto quantity to QUDT quantity kind](https://github.com/Project-Haystack/xeto/blob/master/src/xeto/sys.rdf/qudt-quantities.props)
- [Xeto units without a QUDT mapping](https://github.com/Project-Haystack/xeto/blob/master/src/xeto/sys.rdf/qudt-unmapped-units.props)
- [Xeto quantities without a QUDT mapping](https://github.com/Project-Haystack/xeto/blob/master/src/xeto/sys.rdf/qudt-unmapped-quantities.props)

The QUDT release, source graphs, revision, and namespace IRIs used by these
tables are pinned in the
[Xeto-to-QUDT mapping metadata](https://github.com/Project-Haystack/xeto/blob/master/src/xeto/sys.rdf/qudt-meta.props).
Changing that file is an explicit mapping-version upgrade.

Mapped rows have the form `xetoName=qudtLocalName`. A quantity may list more
than one comma-separated QUDT quantity kind when QUDT uses distinct kinds for
units that Xeto groups together. Unmapped rows use
`xetoName=reasonCode|reviewNote`. The fixed QUDT namespaces are
`http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/` for physical units,
`http://qudt.org/vocab/currency/` for currencies, and
`http://qudt.org/vocab/quantitykind/` for quantity kinds. For example:

```properties
fahrenheit=DEG_F
us_dollar=USD
temperature=Temperature
velocity=Velocity,Speed
belarussian_ruble=noEquivalent|QUDT 2.1 currency graph does not contain obsolete ISO 4217 code BYR
```

The Xeto unit's quantity determines the target namespace. Thus
`fahrenheit=DEG_F` maps to `unit:DEG_F`, while the Xeto currency unit
`us_dollar=USD` maps to `currency:USD`. QUDT types currency resources as
`qudt:CurrencyUnit`, a subclass of `qudt:Unit`.

Xeto units can be written using their full names or any symbol defined for the
same unit. The unit mapping properties file contains one entry per unit, keyed
by its full Xeto name. Before applying the mapping, an implementation resolves
any symbol to the full Xeto unit name, then maps it to the corresponding QUDT
unit. A Xeto `quantity` constraint is looked up by its `sys::UnitQuantity` name
in the quantity-kind mapping.

The mapping preserves the original unit and numeric value. It does not convert
a number into another unit. For example, `32°F` maps to the value `32` with
unit `unit:DEG_F`; it is not converted to `0°C`.

Every current Xeto unit and quantity appears in exactly one mapped or unmapped
inventory. An exporter does not guess a QUDT resource from a similar name or
symbol. A value classified as unmapped is an export error; its inventory row
records why no correspondence is defined.

QUDT publishes its unit definitions in the
[QUDT Units Vocabulary](https://www.qudt.org/doc/DOC_VOCAB-UNITS.html) and
provides downloadable vocabulary graphs through the
[QUDT catalog](https://www.qudt.org/catalog/qudt-catalog.html).

### SHACL Validation

A `Unit` slot contains a canonical QUDT unit IRI. The shape requires
`qudt:Unit`. If the slot specifies a quantity, the unit's QUDT quantity kind
must match it directly or through the hierarchy described below. The validator
reads those relationships from the separately loaded QUDT vocabulary graph.

```xeto
Sensor : Dict {
  unit: Unit <quantity:"temperature">
}
```

```turtle
ex:Sensor a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Sensor ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Sensor.unit ;
    sh:class qudt:Unit ;
    sh:node [
      sh:property [
        sh:path (
          qudt:hasQuantityKind
          [ sh:zeroOrMorePath skos:broader ]
        ) ;
        sh:hasValue quantitykind:Temperature ;
      ]
    ] ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

#### Quantity Kind Hierarchy

The standard Xeto unit catalog groups each unit under a quantity. For example,
`gallon`, `fluid_ounce`, and `imperial_gallon` are in Xeto's `volume` group.
The quantity-kind mapping relates that Xeto quantity to
`quantitykind:Volume`:

```properties
volume=Volume
```

QUDT gives some units a more specific quantity kind. In the pinned QUDT graph,
the US gallon is classified as `LiquidVolume`, and QUDT identifies
`LiquidVolume` as a narrower concept beneath `Volume`:

```turtle
unit:GAL_US qudt:hasQuantityKind quantitykind:LiquidVolume .

quantitykind:LiquidVolume
  skos:broader quantitykind:Volume .
```

For this mapping, a QUDT quantity kind satisfies a Xeto quantity constraint
when it is the mapped kind or when following one or more QUDT `skos:broader`
relationships reaches the mapped kind. Therefore `unit:GAL_US` satisfies
Xeto's `volume` constraint. Checking only the unit's direct QUDT quantity kind
would incorrectly reject it.

This is a rule of this specification, not a requirement imposed on every QUDT
consumer. The SHACL `sh:zeroOrMorePath` performs the hierarchy traversal
directly, so validation does not require a SKOS reasoner. The separately loaded
QUDT graph must provide both the units' `qudt:hasQuantityKind` statements and
the quantity kinds' `skos:broader` statements. `skos:broader` is defined by the
[W3C SKOS recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#semantic-relations).

Only Xeto units listed in the
[unit mapping](https://github.com/Project-Haystack/xeto/blob/master/src/xeto/sys.rdf/qudt-units.props)
can be exported. Encountering a unit in the unsupported inventory is an export
error.

A number constrained by `unit` or `quantity` is represented as a
`qudt:QuantityValue` node rather than as a plain numeric literal. Numeric range
constraints apply to `qudt:numericValue`; unit constraints apply to
`qudt:unit`.

```xeto
Meter : Dict {
  percent: Number <minVal:0, maxVal:100, unit:"%">
  power: Number <quantity:"power">
}
```

The `percent` shape is:

```turtle
ex:Meter a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Meter ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Meter.percent ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
    sh:node [
      sh:class qudt:QuantityValue ;
      sh:property [
        sh:path qudt:numericValue ;
        sh:datatype xsd:double ;
        sh:minInclusive "0.0"^^xsd:double ;
        sh:maxInclusive "100.0"^^xsd:double ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
        sh:maxCount 1 ;
      ] ;
      sh:property [
        sh:path qudt:unit ;
        sh:class qudt:Unit ;
        sh:hasValue unit:PERCENT ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
        sh:maxCount 1 ;
      ]
    ] ;
  ] .
```

The `power` shape has the same structure but replaces the exact unit with a
`qudt:hasQuantityKind quantitykind:Power` constraint.

### Instance Data

A `Unit` value becomes its canonical QUDT unit IRI:

```turtle
ex:sensor1 ex:Sensor.unit unit:DEG_F .
```

A unit-bearing number becomes a `qudt:QuantityValue` node:

```xeto
@meter1: Meter {
  percent: 50%
  power: 1kW
}
```

```turtle
ex:meter1 a sys:Entity, ex:Meter ;
  ex:Meter.percent [
    a qudt:QuantityValue ;
    qudt:numericValue "50.0"^^xsd:double ;
    qudt:unit unit:PERCENT
  ] ;
  ex:Meter.power [
    a qudt:QuantityValue ;
    qudt:numericValue "1.0"^^xsd:double ;
    qudt:unit unit:KiloW
  ] .
```

Currency units follow the same Number rule:

```xeto
Invoice : Dict {
  price: Number <unit:"\$">
}

@invoice1: Invoice {
  price: 19.99$
}
```

```turtle
ex:invoice1 ex:Invoice.price [
  a qudt:QuantityValue ;
  qudt:numericValue "19.99"^^xsd:double ;
  qudt:unit currency:USD
] .
```

The exporter does not round currency to a fixed number of decimal places or
claim exact decimal arithmetic that the Xeto value does not provide. An
application that requires accounting semantics must define its own rounding
or integer-minor-unit convention before RDF export.

The QUDT declarations and quantity-kind facts referenced by these values are
loaded separately during validation as described under
[Metadata and External Vocabularies](Metadata.md#metadata-and-external-vocabularies).

## Standalone UnitQuantity Values

A standalone `UnitQuantity` value maps to `sys:UnitQuantity.<key>`, using the
exact, case-sensitive enum key and the versioned `sys` namespace. One Xeto
quantity can correspond to several QUDT quantity kinds, or have no QUDT match.
Giving it its own resource preserves one Xeto value without choosing a single
QUDT match or turning it into several values.

```xeto
Reading : Dict {
  quantity: UnitQuantity
}

@reading1: Reading { quantity: "energy" }
```

```turtle
ex:reading1 a sys:Entity, ex:Reading ;
  ex:Reading.quantity sys:UnitQuantity.energy .

sys:UnitQuantity.energy a sys:UnitQuantity ;
  rdfs:label "energy"@en ;
  rdfs:seeAlso quantitykind:Energy, quantitykind:MomentOfForce,
    quantitykind:Torque .
```

Each quantity resource has a label and `rdfs:seeAlso` links to its matching
QUDT quantity kinds, of which there may be several. For example, Xeto's
`energy` category maps to both `quantitykind:Energy` and `quantitykind:Torque`.
These links do not assert equivalence: the link to `quantitykind:Torque` does
not mean that every instance with quantity `energy` measures torque. A quantity without
a QUDT match, such as `powerByVolumetricFlow`, has its own resource and label,
but no QUDT links.

All standalone `UnitQuantity` slots reference a shared
`sys:UnitQuantityShape`:

```turtle
sys:UnitQuantityShape a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
  sh:in (sys:UnitQuantity.energy sys:UnitQuantity.temperature # ...
  ) .
```

Each exported schema graph containing a `UnitQuantity` slot includes this
shape once. It requires the value to be an IRI from the quantity catalog.
The `sh:in` list contains a resource for every effective `sys::UnitQuantity`
enum entry, using the versioned `sys` namespace. The example above abbreviates
that list.

The property shape for each standalone `UnitQuantity` slot references the
shared shape and defines that slot's cardinality and invariant constraints.
For example, `Reading.quantity`
requires exactly one quantity value:

```turtle
ex:Reading a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Reading ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Reading.quantity ;
    sh:node sys:UnitQuantityShape ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1
  ] .
```

An optional slot omits `sh:minCount`. An invariant adds, for example,
`sh:hasValue sys:UnitQuantity.energy`.

## Queries

A Xeto `Query` is computed navigation, not a stored required field. It selects
records by following references from a starting record. This section calls a
SPARQL query that performs that selection over exported RDF data a
**SPARQL selection query**. The term Query refers to the Xeto definition;
SPARQL selection query refers to its SPARQL translation.

Query traversal uses the [reference-field metadata](#reference-field-metadata)
in exported instance data to distinguish Refs from other IRI-valued fields.

### SHACL Validation

Query slots without named body requirements impose no validation constraints. Their
`via` or `inverse` metadata is retained as a SHACL property path, without
`sh:class`, `sh:minCount`, or `sh:maxCount`. The `of` type selects query results;
it does not require every record along the path to have that type.

#### Supported Query Paths

```xeto
Equip : Dict {
  plainPoints: Query<of:Point>
  points: Query<of:Point, inverse:"Point.equips">
}

Point : Dict {
  equipRef: Ref<of:Equip>
  equips: Query<of:Equip, via:"equipRef+">
}

Node : Dict {
  next: Ref<of:Node, maybe>
  reachable: Query<of:Node, via:"next*">
}
```

```turtle
ex:Equip a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Equip ;
  sh:property [
    # Equip.plainPoints
    sh:path ex:Equip.plainPoints ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    # Equip.points: inverse of Point.equips
    sh:path [
      sh:oneOrMorePath [ sh:inversePath ex:Point.equipRef ]
    ] ;
  ] .

ex:Point a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Point ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Point.equipRef ;
    sh:class ex:Equip ;
    sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    # Point.equips: follows equipRef one or more times
    sh:path [ sh:oneOrMorePath ex:Point.equipRef ] ;
  ] .

ex:Node a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Node ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Node.next ;
    sh:class ex:Node ;
    sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    # Node.reachable: follows next zero or more times
    sh:path [ sh:zeroOrMorePath ex:Node.next ] ;
  ] .
```

A Query without named body requirements does not require a particular number
of matches. Its path may reach no records, one record, or many records. Only
records that fit the Query's `of` type are returned; reaching other types does
not invalidate the record containing the Query. A `+` path follows one or more
references and may pass through records that do not fit `of`. Cycles are allowed,
and each matching record is returned once.

The Query's SHACL property path imposes no class or cardinality constraint.
Constraints on the stored Ref or MultiRef remain unchanged: `Ref<of:Point>`
still requires its referenced record to have class Point. Query execution and
validation of the returned records are separate operations.

Given only this instance relationship:

```turtle
ex:point1 ex:Point.equipRef ex:equip1 .
```

the inverse path can navigate from `ex:equip1` to `ex:point1`. The instance
graph does not need this materialized reverse triple:

```turtle
ex:equip1 ex:Equip.points ex:point1 .
```

A plain query without `via` or `inverse` uses its slot property as `sh:path`,
but still has no cardinality constraint. Exporting schema SHACL and compiling
Query-body validation are separate operations. The schema-only exporter does
not yet support Query bodies; the Query compiler produces the SPARQL and SHACL
needed to check required and optional body members. See
[Query-Body Validation](Queries.md#query-body-validation) and
[Deferred Mappings](Deferred.md#deferred-mappings).

`via` and `inverse` are mutually exclusive. A `via` path is an unqualified
slot name, a `Spec.slot` name, or a fully qualified `lib::Spec.slot` name,
optionally followed by `+` or `*`. An `inverse` reference uses the same name
forms without a path suffix. Empty paths, malformed names, repeated suffixes,
and a Query declaring both forms are export errors.

#### Rejected Query Metadata

The following complete definitions are rejected during RDF export. Declaring
both traversal forms is ambiguous:

```xeto
Point : Dict
Equip : Dict {
  points: Query<of:Point, via:"pointRef", inverse:"Point.equips">
}
```

The exporter reports that `fixture.example::Equip.points` cannot declare both
`via` and `inverse`.

An empty traversal does not identify a property:

```xeto
Point : Dict
Equip : Dict {
  points: Query<of:Point, via:"">
}
```

The exporter reports `Empty query path for fixture.example::Equip.points`.
The same rule applies to an empty `inverse` value.

A path may have at most one trailing quantifier:

```xeto
Point : Dict
Equip : Dict {
  points: Query<of:Point, via:"pointRef++">
}
```

The exporter reports an invalid Query path for
`fixture.example::Equip.points`, including the rejected value `pointRef++`.

#### Inverse Query and Direct Inverse Property

An inverse reference is resolved in the library that declares the Query. If
the referenced name identifies another Query, that Query must declare `via`;
the exporter reverses its `via` path. If the name identifies an ordinary
property, or no Query declaration with that name is present, the exporter
reverses the named property directly. These two cases are deliberately
distinct:

```xeto
Equip : Dict {
  // Reverses the traversal declared by Point.equips.
  points: Query<of:Point, inverse:"Point.equips">

  // Reverses Point.equipRef directly.
  directPoints: Query<of:Point, inverse:"Point.equipRef">
}

Point : Dict {
  equipRef: Ref<of:Equip>
  equips: Query<of:Equip, via:"equipRef+">
}
```

```turtle
ex:Equip a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Equip ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path [
      sh:oneOrMorePath [ sh:inversePath ex:Point.equipRef ]
    ] ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ex:Point.equipRef ] ;
  ] .
```

`Equip.points` reverses the referenced Query's `equipRef+` traversal, so its
path retains `sh:oneOrMorePath`. `Equip.directPoints` reverses the ordinary
`Point.equipRef` property directly, so its path has no repetition operator.

A referenced Query without `via` does not contain enough traversal metadata
to invert and is therefore an export error. It is not silently treated as an
ordinary stored property.

### Queries Contributed by Mixins

A query contributed by a mixin may traverse a slot from the contributing
library or a slot from the target spec's library. The path name determines
which RDF predicate SHACL follows.

**Example: `mixin-query-paths`.**

Suppose `base.equips` defines:

```xeto
Equip : Dict {
  basePointRef: Ref<of:Point, maybe>
}

Point : Dict
```

and `app.equips` contributes:

```xeto
+base.equips::Equip {
  pointRef: Ref<of:base.equips::Point, maybe>
  pointsVia: Query<of:base.equips::Point, via:"pointRef">
  pointsViaBase: Query<of:base.equips::Point,
    via:"base.equips::Equip.basePointRef">
  pointsInverse: Query<of:base.equips::Point, inverse:"Point.equips">
}

+base.equips::Point {
  equipRef: Ref<of:base.equips::Equip, maybe>
  equips: Query<of:base.equips::Equip, via:"equipRef">
}
```

The relevant part of the resulting target shape is:

```turtle
base:Equip a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass base:Equip ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path app:Equip.pointRef ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path base:Equip.basePointRef ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path [ sh:inversePath app:Point.equipRef ] ;
  ] .
```

For `pointsVia`, the unqualified `pointRef` resolves in the contributing
`app.equips` library, producing `app:Equip.pointRef`. For `pointsViaBase`, the
full name explicitly selects `base:Equip.basePointRef`. This determines which
RDF relationships SHACL follows; the two paths are not interchangeable.

For `pointsInverse`, `Point.equips` first resolves to the query contributed by
`app.equips`. That query traverses `app:Point.equipRef`, so reversing it
produces `[ sh:inversePath app:Point.equipRef ]`.

## Intersections and Unions

An intersection is a subtype of every member:

```xeto
Named : Dict { dis: Str }
Located : Dict { geoCity: Str }
NamedLocation : Named & Located
```

### Vocabulary

```turtle
ex:Named a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf sys:Dict .

ex:Named.dis a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "dis"@en .

ex:Located a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf sys:Dict .

ex:Located.geoCity a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "geoCity"@en .

ex:NamedLocation a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf ex:Named, ex:Located ;
  rdfs:label "NamedLocation"@en .
```

The inherited slots keep the property IRIs of the specs that declared them:
`ex:Named.dis` and `ex:Located.geoCity`. They are not copied to new properties
such as `ex:NamedLocation.dis`.

A union is a supertype of every member:

```xeto
Heating : Dict
Cooling : Dict
ThermalProcess : Heating | Cooling
```

```turtle
ex:ThermalProcess a sys:Class, rdfs:Class .

ex:Heating a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf ex:ThermalProcess .

ex:Cooling a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf ex:ThermalProcess .
```

### SHACL Validation

**Intersection.** The member shapes define the constraints inherited by an
intersection:

```turtle
ex:Named a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Named ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Named.dis ;
    sh:datatype xsd:string ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .

ex:Located a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Located ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:Located.geoCity ;
    sh:datatype xsd:string ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

Because `NamedLocation` is a subtype of both `Named` and `Located`, its
instances must satisfy both shapes.

**Union.** A union shape requires an instance to use at least one concrete
member class:

```turtle
ex:ThermalProcess a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:ThermalProcess ;
  sh:or (
    [ sh:class ex:Heating ]
    [ sh:class ex:Cooling ]
  ) .
```

This Xeto instance selects the concrete `Heating` member:

```xeto
@heating1: Heating {}
```

Its RDF representation conforms to the union shape because its type is one of
the member classes:

```turtle
ex:heating1 a sys:Entity, ex:Heating .
```

The union type itself cannot be used as the instance's concrete type:

```xeto
// Invalid: no concrete union member is selected.
@process1: ThermalProcess {}
```

If represented in RDF, that invalid instance names only the union class:

```turtle
ex:process1 a sys:Entity, ex:ThermalProcess .
```

That RDF fails `sh:or` because it has neither `rdf:type ex:Heating` nor
`rdf:type ex:Cooling`. Adding fields associated with a member does not select
that member; the instance must use the member spec as its concrete Xeto type.
The `rdfs:subClassOf` statements still make valid `Heating` and `Cooling`
instances members of `ThermalProcess`.

## Globals and Covariant Overrides

A global slot defines a contract for uses of the same slot name on descendant
specs. A global is implicitly optional and cannot declare `maybe`. Any
descendant that declares or supplies the slot must preserve the global
contract:

```xeto
Person : Dict {
  *height: Number <minVal:0, maxVal:300>
}

TallPerson : Person {
  height: Int <minVal:100>
}
```

`TallPerson.height` is a valid narrowing: `Int` is narrower than `Number`,
`minVal:100` raises the inherited minimum of zero, and the inherited maximum
remains 300.

This override instead widens the value space to an unrelated type, so Xeto
rejects it before RDF is emitted:

```xeto
InvalidPerson : Person {
  height: Str
}
```

### Vocabulary

A concrete slot that overrides a known global is an RDF subproperty of the
global slot property:

```turtle
ex:Person.height a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "height"@en .

ex:TallPerson.height a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "height"@en ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf ex:Person.height .
```

The subproperty statement records where the concrete slot contract came from.
It does not by itself enforce the inherited datatype or numeric bounds.

### SHACL Validation

The effective `TallPerson.height` shape combines the override with inherited
global metadata:

```turtle
ex:TallPerson a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:TallPerson ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:TallPerson.height ;
    sh:datatype xsd:integer ;
    sh:minInclusive 100 ;
    sh:maxInclusive 300 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

The shape uses `xsd:integer` and `sh:minInclusive 100` from the narrower
override, while `sh:maxInclusive 300` and the optional cardinality come from
the global contract. Xeto requires an overriding slot to narrow, rather than
widen, the inherited slot. The exporter checks that rule before producing RDF
and rejects an invalid override. SHACL then validates instance data against the
accepted effective slot. SHACL is not used to decide whether a Xeto slot
override only narrows the slot it overrides.

### Instance Data

Global-backed values use the concrete slot property of the instance's spec:

```xeto
@tall1: TallPerson {
  height: 175
}
```

```turtle
ex:tall1 a sys:Entity, ex:TallPerson ;
  ex:TallPerson.height "175"^^xsd:integer .
```

The same RDF structure with a value above 300 fails the inherited
`sh:maxInclusive` constraint. Omitting `height` remains valid because the
global declared it as `maybe`.

## Sealed Specs

`sealed` controls where a Xeto spec may be extended. A sealed spec may have
subtypes in its own library but not in another library. The exporter receives a
namespace only after Xeto has enforced this rule, so `sealed` does not add a
SHACL instance constraint or require an RDF vocabulary statement.

```xeto
Command : Dict <sealed>
```

An exporter reports an error if its input namespace contains an external
subtype of `Command`; it does not emit a weaker graph for that invalid schema.

## Mixins

A mixin adds slots to an existing spec in the active namespace. It does not
become a second RDF class. The target spec receives the mixin constraints, while
each contributed slot keeps the IRI of the library that contributed it.

`base.people` defines:

```xeto
Person : Dict {
  dis: Str
}
```

`app.people` defines:

```xeto
Org : Dict

+Person {
  badge: Str?
  staff
  orgRef: Ref<of:Org>
}
```

### Vocabulary

```turtle
app:Org a sys:Class, rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf sys:Dict ;
  rdfs:label "Org"@en .

app:Person.badge a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "badge"@en .

app:Person.staff a sys:Marker ;
  rdfs:label "staff"@en .

base:Person sys:hasMarker app:Person.staff .

app:Person.orgRef a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "orgRef"@en .
```

There is no `app:Person` class. The `app:Person.badge`, `app:Person.staff`, and
`app:Person.orgRef` IRIs identify the scalar, marker, and reference slots
contributed by `app.people`.

### SHACL Validation

In a namespace containing both libraries, the mixin constraints are added to
the effective target shape:

```turtle
base:Person a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass base:Person ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path base:Person.dis ;
    sh:datatype xsd:string ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path app:Person.badge ;
    sh:datatype xsd:string ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path sys:hasMarker ;
    sh:hasValue app:Person.staff ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path app:Person.orgRef ;
    sh:class app:Org ;
    sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 1 ;
  ] .
```

The subject being validated remains a `base:Person`. Other supported slot forms
contributed by a mixin use their ordinary validation mappings on the target
shape.

Mixin query-path ownership is defined under
[Queries Contributed by Mixins](#queries-contributed-by-mixins).

### Instance Data

An instance uses the target spec's class and the contributed slots' own IRIs:

```xeto
@o1: Org {}

@p1: base.people::Person {
  dis: "Ann"
  badge: "A-17"
  staff
  orgRef: @o1
}
```

```turtle
app:o1 a sys:Entity, app:Org .

app:p1 a sys:Entity, base:Person ;
  base:Person.dis "Ann"^^xsd:string ;
  app:Person.badge "A-17"^^xsd:string ;
  sys:hasMarker app:Person.staff ;
  app:Person.orgRef app:o1 .
```
