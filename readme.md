# Overview

Xeto is a data-only type system.  The name is derived from the phrase "eXtensible
Explicitly Typed Objects".  Xeto defines a simple plain text format used to
declare types and to exchange typed data.  It is designed to build and validate
[Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/) data models.  But Xeto is general
purpose enough to use with any structured data including CSV, JSON, or SQL data.

This repository is used to manage the source code for the standard libraries.
